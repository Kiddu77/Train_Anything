# Train_Anything
A repo to get you cracking with Neural Nets.

This repository consists of a number of training models which are designed to complete specific tasks.
These are all deep neural networks (Transformers and CNNs are represented in another repository)

This can be understood as what happens to the weights upon modification.
They become better by going to the local minimum of the loss curve graph

You can perform just about anything with deep neural networks as it is fundamentall based on the neural network architecture of the brain.
